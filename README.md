#### Description:
This project is a fully-featured European Roulette game built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. European Roulette features 37 pockets numbered 0-36 rather than the American variant's 38, giving players slightly better odds. The game runs completely client-side in the browser without requiring any backend infrastructure, external libraries, or frameworks, making it lightweight and easy to deploy anywhere.
The game simulates a complete casino roulette experience with an animated spinning wheel, comprehensive betting options, realistic payout calculations, and a player balance management system. Players can place various types of bets including straight bets on individual numbers, dozen bets covering groups of 12 numbers, column bets, and outside bets like red/black, odd/even, and high/low ranges. The wheel features smooth spinning animations with realistic deceleration, and a golden arrow pointer at the top clearly indicates which number wins after each spin.
The project consists of three main files: index.html, style.css, and script.js. The HTML file provides the structural foundation, defining the layout with a stats bar showing balance and last winning number, a wheel section on the left with control buttons, and a betting table section on the right with chip selectors and the interactive betting grid. Each interactive element includes appropriate IDs and data attributes to facilitate event handling. The HTML also includes a deposit modal that appears when players want to add money to their balance, allowing for custom deposit amounts rather than fixed increments.
The CSS file handles all visual presentation and creates the casino aesthetic with a color scheme using deep greens reminiscent of casino felt, accented with gold for premium elements and proper red/black coloring for roulette numbers. The roulette wheel is created entirely with CSS, featuring a circular design with a golden center medallion and shadow effects for depth. I chose to build the wheel using HTML elements and CSS positioning rather than Canvas or SVG because it keeps the DOM directly accessible for animations and makes individual numbers easily targetable for highlighting effects. The layout uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsiveness, adjusting from a two-column layout on desktop to single-column on smaller screens. Multiple animation systems are implemented including the wheel spin with custom cubic-bezier timing for realistic deceleration, a pulsing golden glow effect for winning numbers, and smooth hover transitions on all interactive elements.
The JavaScript file contains all game logic and state management. It maintains key state variables including player balance starting at $1000, active bets stored in an object that maps bet identifiers to bet details, the selected chip denomination, and flags for whether the wheel is currently spinning. The wheel is generated dynamically using the authentic European wheel number sequence, with each number positioned using trigonometric functions to calculate coordinates along a circle. This mathematical approach ensures perfect circular arrangement without manual positioning of each element.
The betting system supports multiple bet types with accurate payouts: straight bets on single numbers pay 35:1, dozen and column bets pay 2:1, and outside bets like red/black pay 1:1. When players click a betting spot, the placeBet() function validates sufficient balance, creates or updates the bet object, deducts the amount, and displays a visual chip on the table. The chip color corresponds to its denomination for clear visual feedback. I implemented a flexible chip selector allowing players to choose from $1, $5, $10, $25, and $100 denominations before placing bets, making it easy to quickly place bets of varying sizes.
The spin mechanics are handled by the spinWheel() function, which orchestrates the entire sequence. It first validates that bets exist, then randomly selects a winning number and calculates the precise rotation angle needed to land on it. The function applies CSS transforms to both the wheel and ball with a 4-second animation duration, using async/await to pause execution during the animation. After the spin completes, the winning number pulses with a golden highlight, and the calculateWinnings() function iterates through all active bets to determine winners and calculate payouts. The function correctly handles edge cases like zero not counting for even/odd bets and uses proper modulo math for column bets.
One significant design decision was the deposit system. Rather than implementing a fixed deposit amount button, I created a custom modal interface allowing players to deposit any amount they choose. The modal includes quick-select buttons for common amounts from $100 to $50,000, but also accepts any custom positive integer in the input field. This design provides flexibility for different play styles and bankroll management strategies. The modal maintains the game's visual style and provides better user experience than JavaScript's built-in prompt function, which would break the immersive casino atmosphere.
I deliberately avoided using external libraries or frameworks like React or jQuery. This constraint forced a deeper understanding of vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation, resulted in smaller file size and faster load times, and eliminated dependency management concerns. The trade-off is more verbose code in places, but the educational value and performance benefits justified this approach. The 4-second spin duration was chosen after testing various timings because shorter durations felt rushed while longer ones made the game tedious, and the cubic-bezier easing function creates realistic deceleration that mimics physical wheel physics.
The project was initially developed as a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript for rapid prototyping. Once the core functionality was proven, I refactored it into three separate files following web development best practices. This separation improves maintainability, allows for better code organization, and makes the project easier to understand and modify. The betting grid uses a simplified layout rather than attempting to perfectly replicate a real roulette table's complex shape, which made it more responsive and easier to interact with on various screen sizes while still providing all necessary betting options.
To run the game, simply open index.html in any modern web browser. No build process, server, or installation is required. The game works completely offline and is immediately playable, making it accessible to anyone with a web browser.
